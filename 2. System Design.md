In system design, File and Database Storage Systems play a pivotal role in managing and organizing data efficiently. These systems provide the foundation for storing, retrieving, and organizing information in applications, ensuring data integrity and accessibility. **File systems** handle structured and unstructured data, while **database systems** offer structured data management with advanced querying capabilities. Effective integration of these storage systems is essential for designing *scalable and reliable* software applications, making them integral components of modern system architecture.

1. File-based storage system
- store in files
- store on hard drive or network attached storage(NAS) device
- Examples: cloud-based file storage systems, network drives, computer hard drives, and flash drives.
- Pros
    - Files can be easily accessed by a user on a small scale and can be easily managed.
- Cons
    - Maintaining and retrieving a large number of files can be challenging.
    - It is hard to work with unstructured data and becomes expensive at large levels.

2. Database file-based storage system
-  database management system (DBMS)
- Examples: Microsoft Access, SQLite, FlatfileDB etc.
- Pros
    - small datasets good performance
    - portable
- Cons
    - not as powerful or flexible as relational databases and has limited scalability.
    - vulnerable to data corruption and loss.
    - Managing large datasets might be difficult for the users.

3. Hadoop Distributed File System
- the files are stored across **multiple machines** in redundant fashion to rescue the system from possible data losses in case of failure. 
- HDFS is highly fault-tolerant and designed using low-cost hardware.

4. RDBMS:  Relational Database Management System
- based on the relational model introduced by. It stores data in the form of **tables** ( having rows, columns and tuples) with the help of Structured Query Language (SQL) to access the database.
